This library provides various Python modules and scripts to perform semi-supervised learning with heterophily (SSLH). 
It includes methods to perform label propagation with linearized belief propagation 
and to estimate class-to-class compatibilities from very sparsely labeled graphs,
extending an earlier release of [SSLH](https://pypi.org/project/sslh/) and [prior ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3100). 
Also included are code and experimental traces to reproduce the experiments from our [SIGMOD 2020](http://sigmod2020.org/) paper:
[Factorized Graph Representations for Semi-supervised Learning from Sparse Labels](https://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3380577)

**Overview of SSLH:** 
Given a partially labeled graph and a class-to-class compatibility matrix, linearized belief propagation (LinBP) performs a generalized form of label propagation to label the remaining nodes.
Distant compatibility estimation (DCE) performs the same function but *does not require the compatibility matrix as input*. 
For quick understanding of the approach, please also see the video presented at SIGMOD 2020:

## Real data sets
A copy of the 8 real datasets we used in our experiments is available in the form of 16 CSV files totaling 1.2GB on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fqTgfW8f-PUwnAj432YgsFVjgbUdOHuu?usp=sharing). 
To run the experiments, place them into the folder `experiments_sigmod20/realData/`, then run the respective methods in `experiments_sigmod20/`.


## Usage
1. For examples on the usage of the various methods, please see the `test_sslh` directory in the source tree.
2. [/reproducibility.md](https://github.com/northeastern-datalab/factorized-graphs/blob/master/reproducibility.md) contains a detailed description to reproduce the experimental results reported in the paper (as submitted to the [ACM SIGMOD 2021 Reproducibility](https://reproducibility.sigmod.org/)).
